Things to do
============

I'm forever thinking of projects I'd like to do (or like to see done), and hence
decided to start collecting some of them, so I don't forget (something I tend to do).

 - A visual implementation of a functional (hopefully dependently typed?) language to see
   if it'd help with functional (especially dependently typed) languages' "image problem".
 - Following the [Erdős number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number), the
   [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)
   of film, and their illegitimate child the
   [Erdős–Bacon number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number),
   start calculating rappers' "Dre numbers" (or some other artist with a lot of
   collaborations across some length of time).
